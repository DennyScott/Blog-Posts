# Making a Unity Work Environment
##My Life, 1989 - Now
I despise MonoDevelop. Developing in Unity has generally been a treat. The version control isn't always the greatest, but in a transition from generally coding the whole framework of a game, Unity has always had huge upsides. As what seems to be the norm, I use C# for scripting. Aside from the fact that it is also required for editor coding, when you work in Javascript all day, it can sometimes be a treat working in a rigidly OO, strong-typed language.

**But I can't stand Monodevelop.** It's Vim emulation is spotty, I don't like the available color themes, its slow, it doesn't have a strong community behind it, and most importantly, you can't open multiple windows in it. 

This is 2015. My toaster can open multiple windows.

While developing Mobile Apps, Vim has normally been my go-to text-editor. I've also been inclined to use Sublime for a number of projects, on days that plugins frustrate me (when your using plugins last updated in 2005, you know desperation). Latley, a lot of my projects at work revolve around Unity development. Having worked a lot with Unity in my spare time, I was more then happy to dig my teeth into these new projects. But then my old familiar nemesis returned. Monodevelop.

I realize a good solution would be to use Visual Studio, and I understand a large amount of Unity developers use VS. In honesty, I have not tried Visual Studio, though I'm sure I will use it (or the dreaded MonoDevelop) for Debugging scripts one of these days, so I can't give it a rating in either way. But I decided some time ago that for me personally, I'm going to change my Unity editing environment to Vim. 

This is a lesson for another day. 

When I showed some of my colleagues the success I had with Vim, and about my new freedom from Monodevelop, I had expected celebrations, a revoltion throughout the office, possibly [a small statue made out of pure gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMjYY3tbX1k). But only one question came out of there mouths.

"Vim? Can you do that in Sublime Text?"
(Ok thats sort of two questions, but you get the point.)

So here it is my fickle friends, a way to use Sublime Text as your primary development environment with Sublime. Lets outline some of the goals.

We want:
* 

* Home Brew
* Mono
* Omnisharp Sublime
* Use the Sync Mono Project
* Omnisharp Reload Solution
* Add the predawn theme
* Add the Inconsolata Font To System
* Create custom Settings
* Add C# Settings
* Change the Sublime Text Icon
* Dayle Rees color scheme, Bold
* SublimeText Syntax Fold
* Set C# to default for Syntax Fold
* DocBlockr
* xmldocs (Folding code will cause issues with Omnisharp)
* Unity.tmTheme (Show how regions are done)

# ToDo
* Write Blog on Unity/Sublime
* Finish Article on REST in Unity
* Fix Calculator and Statistics on Return2Sleep
* Fix Videos on Return2Sleep
* Refactor Query/Parse in Unity
